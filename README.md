Multiple object tracking experiment
==============
This program is super-complicated, legacy of many different papers using tracking. I don't recommend you use it without my guidance. My other repositories, such as attentional-blink, are more user-friendly.

In the long term, want to set up exchange of objects among rings. Necessary to conduct an identity-tracking experiment. Can also push harder on speed limit that way.

### Issues
-Improve anonymisation algorithm

## Subsidiary experiments

- [Centered vs. peripheral](experiment_specific/rps_limit/centered_vs_peripheral.md)

- [Square traj, modulations](experiment_specific/rps_limit/square.md)
