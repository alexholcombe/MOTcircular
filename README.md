Multiple object tracking experiment
==============
THIS REPOSITORY HAS BEEN SUPERSEDED BY [MOTCircularClean](https://github.com/alexholcombe/MOTcircularClean), for two reasons: 1) updating eyetracking code because Eyelink changed their EyeLinkCoreGraphicsPsychoPy.py file, and 2) Because the datafiles of the subidiary experiments (see below) were too cumbersome when sending to someone

This program is super-complicated, legacy of many different papers using tracking. I don't recommend you use it without my guidance. My other repositories, such as attentional-blink, are more user-friendly.

In the long term, want to set up exchange of objects among rings. Necessary to conduct an identity-tracking experiment. Can also push harder on speed limit that way.

### Issues
-Improve anonymisation algorithm

## Subsidiary experiments

- [Centered vs. peripheral](experiment_specific/rps_limit/centered_vs_peripheral.md)

- [Square traj, modulations](experiment_specific/rps_limit/square.md)

- [Transient attention (abandoned study with Ingrid and Arni](https://github.com/alexholcombe/MOTcircular/tree/master/experiment_specific/transient_attention)

## Eyetracking

To the self-test of eyetrackingCode/EyeLinkCoreGraphicsPsychoPyHolcombeLab.py, I've tried to add a trial.
