 "Screencap of the KNM paper")

- The cue appears (and stays on) `cueLeadTime` before the target iris displaces.
- The eyeballs appear. Shortly after, the iris displaces. Do we ever want the eyeballs on during the cue? 
- Task is to report the iris offset of the cued ball.

Contrast some conditions

- Classic Nakayama & Mackeben. The cue comes on, no motion. Then stimuli come on.
- The cue moves for several hundred ms before it stops and objects then appear.
- Have to be able to test attention both at final destination and at other locations, such as earlier in trajectory.
- Basic condition is for cue to stop cold when target appears, stationary. Also have to try having target appear in motion, cue continuing to move with it.

- Downside: adds temporal uncertainty to when target will appear.
- Downside: endogenous attention may have time to get there, so need to make sure there's really a transient-attention bump there

## Concerns

* Why do the stimuli come on later rather than them being on throughout with the eyeball displacing at target time? Well, the eyeball displacement would be a transient that would grab attention. Could avoid this by having all the eyeballs displace, just in random directions.

* The cue provides a frame itself to judge the offset of the target relative to. Esp. because currently the cue and thin wedge are more similar in brightness than are the thick wedge and thin wedge.
