This is an R Markdown document.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Unfortunately there's no way to centre the axes inside the data region, whether with ggplot or R base

```{r}
r = 3
thetas =seq(0,2*pi,by=0.01)    
x=r*cos(thetas)
y=r*sin(thetas)
df=data.frame(thetas=thetas,x=x,y=y)
g<-ggplot(df,aes(x,y)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() 
show(g)
#to see actually what will be plotted and compare 
#    qplot(clarity, data=diamonds, fill=cut, geom="bar")
#save the plot in a variable image to be able to export to svg
#    image=qplot(clarity, data=diamonds, fill=cut, geom="bar")
#This actually save the plot in a image
#    ggsave(file="test.svg", plot=image, width=10, height=8)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
